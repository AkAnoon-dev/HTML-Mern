    <p><u><b>Nikola Tesla</b></u> (10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American engineer, futurist, and inventor. 
        He is known for his contributions to the design of the <i>modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.[2]
</i> and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree.
He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884, he immigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.
He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices.
His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system, which that company eventually marketed.
Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging.
He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.
Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs.
n 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.
After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills.
He died in New York City in January 1943.[3] Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.
There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.[4] Time magazine included Tesla in their "100 Most Significant Figures in History" list.</p>

<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>Nikola Tesla was <i>born on 10 July 1856 in the village of Smiljan,</i> in the Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire (present-day Croatia) into an ethnic Serb family.[7][8] His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.
[9][10] His father's brother Josif was a lecturer at a military academy who wrote several textbooks on mathematics.[11]
Tesla's mother, Georgina "Đuka" Mandić (1822–1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox priest,[12] had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education.
Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.[13][14]
Tesla was the fourth of five children.[15] In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby town of Gospić, where Tesla's father worked as parish priest.
Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. Later in his patent applications, before he obtained American citizenship, Tesla would identify himself as "of Smiljan, Lika, border country of Austria-Hungary"</p>
